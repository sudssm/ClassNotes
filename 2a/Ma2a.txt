stable/attracting points for autonomous diffeqs
uniqueness theorem
Euler/Picard
Cobweb diagrams

diffeqs
separable
exact (Mdx + Ndy = 0, equality partials)
integrating factor (for above)
change variables (u=y/x)
y'+g(x)y = f(x) is linear, use integrating factor (11.1)
bernoulli equation 
variation af parameters (non-homo -> homo)
	nonhomo uses C(t) or gen homo + nonhomo

2 diffeq
linear
reduction order
var coeff
