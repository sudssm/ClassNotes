# ClassNotes

This is a README file for my ClassNotes repo.

Welcome to the notes I've taken in class throughout my time at Caltech! They have become successively more rigorous over time, so you may not find the earlier directories very useful, but alas, make of it what you will.

#### Organizational scheme

Classes currently in session are in the root directory. Otherwise, terms will be labelled by a number followed by a letter, such as *1a*. This would the refer to the **first term of my first year* at Caltech! Within each of these directories you will find the notes from these classes.
